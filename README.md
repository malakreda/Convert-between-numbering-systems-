-Problem description:
This problem is represented in creating a program to convert between the four numbering systems: binary, decimal, octal and hexadecimal.
*Algorithm:
The solving algorithm based on the idea of dividing the number into bits or numbers, then convert each group into the required numbering system.
*Input and Output data:
1.Input: any number of the four numbering systems: binary, decimal, octal, hexadecimal.
2.Output: number in the required numbering system.
*Tests for evaluating the program:
Input (decimal): 123
Output (binary): 1111011

Input (binary): 10101
Output (decimal): 21

Input (hexadecimal): 15
Output (binary): 10101

Input (decimal): 35
Output (octal): 43
